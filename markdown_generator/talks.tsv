SELF & FEIL Emotion Lexicons for Finnish	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	 Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries 2022	2022-03-15	"Uppsala, Sweden"	URL	"I introduce a Sentiment and Emotion Lexicon for Finnish (SELF) and a Finnish Emotion Intensity Lexicon (FEIL). Sentiment analysis and emotion detection require annotated data regardless of the chosen approach, but most existing resources are for the English language. To overcome this, the SELF and FEIL lexicons use projected annotations from existing resources with carefully edited translations and domain adaptations. In this paper the creation process and translation issues are explained in detail to allow others to create similar lexicons for other languages. The usefulness of SELF and FEIL are demonstrated via several interdisciplinary affect-related projects. To our best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive sentiment and emotion lexicon for Finnish."
The Validity of Lexicon-based Emotion Analysis in Interdisciplinary Research	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	 NLP4DH@ICONâ'21 	2021-12-20	Zoom	URL	"Lexicon-based sentiment and emotion analysis methods are widely used particularly in applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects in fields such as computational social science and digital humanities. These lexicon-based methods have often been criticized for their lack of validation and accuracy -- sometimes fairly. However, in this paper, we argue that lexicon-based methods work well particularly when moving up in granularity and show how useful lexicon-based methods can be for projects where neither qualitative analysis nor a machine learning-based approach is possible. Indeed, we argue that the measure of a lexicon's accuracy should be grounded in its usefulness."
Japanese Beauty Marketing on Social Media: Critical Discourse Analysis Meets NLP	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	 NLP4DH@ICONâ'21 	2021-12-19	Zoom	URL	"This project is a pilot study intending to combine traditional corpus linguistics, Natural Language Processing, critical discourse analysis, and digital humanities to gain an up-to-date understanding of how beauty is being marketed on social media, specifically Instagram, to followers. We use topic modeling combined with critical discourse analysis and NLP tools for insights into the ``Japanese Beauty Myth"" and show an overview of the dataset that we make publicly available."

XED: Multilabel Emotion Dataset	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	COLING	2020-12-10	"Barcelone, Spain"	URL	"We introduce XED, a multilingual fine-grained emotion dataset. The dataset consists of human-annotated Finnish (25k) and English sentences (30k), as well as projected annotations for 30 additional languages, providing new resources for many low-resource languages. We use Plutchik's core emotions to annotate the dataset with the addition of neutral to create a multilabel multiclass dataset. The dataset is carefully evaluated using language-specific BERT models and SVMs to show that XED performs on par with other similar datasets and is therefore a useful tool for sentiment analysis and emotion detection.

Emotion Annotation	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	Digital Humanities in the Nordic Countries	2020-10-01	"Riga, Latvia"	URL	"With the prevalence of machine learning in natural language processing and other fields, an increasing number of crowd-sourced data sets are created and published. However, very little has been written about the annotation process from the point of view of the annotators. This pilot study aims to help fill the gap and provide insights into how to maximize the quality of the annotation output of crowd-sourced annotations with a focus on fine-grained sentence-level sentiment and emotion annotation from the annotators point of view.

Creating a Dataset for Multilingual Fine-grained Emotion-detection Using Gamification-based Annotation	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	"  WASSA: EMNLP 2018, October "	2018-10-01	"Brussels, Belgium"	URL	"This paper introduces a gamified framework for fine-grained sentiment analysis and emotion detection. We present a flexible tool, \textit{Sentimentator}, that can be used for efficient annotation based on crowd sourcing and a self-perpetuating gold standard. We also present a novel dataset with multi-dimensional annotations of emotions and sentiments in movie subtitles that enables research on sentiment preservation across languages and the creation of robust multilingual emotion detection tools. The tools and datasets are public and open-source and can easily be extended and applied for various purposes."

Sentimentator: A Sentiment and Emotion Annotation Platform	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	  Digital Humanities in the Nordic Countries 	2018-03-20	"Helsinki, Finland"	URL	"We introduce Sentimentator; a publicly available gamified web-based annotation platform for fine-grained sentiment annotation at the sentence-level. Sentimentator is unique in that it moves beyond binary classification. We use a ten-dimensional model which allows for the annotation of 51 unique sentiments and emotions. The platform is gamified with a complex scoring system designed to reward users for high quality annotations. 
Sentimentator introduces several unique features that have previously not been available, or at best very limited, for sentiment annotation. In particular, it provides streamlined multi-dimensional annotation optimized for sentence-level annotation of movie subtitles.
Because the platform is publicly available it will benefit anyone and everyone interested in fine-grained sentiment analysis and emotion detection, as well as annotation of other datasets."

The Challenges of Multi-dimensional Sentiment Analysis Across Languages	"International conference, peer-reviewed"	URL	  PEOPLES: CoLing	2016-12-10	"Osaka, Japan"	URL	"We outline a pilot study on multi-dimensional and multilingual sentiment analysis of social media content. We use parallel corpora of movie subtitles as a proxy for colloquial language in social media channels and a multilingual emotion lexicon for fine-grained sentiment analyses. Parallel data sets make it possible to study the preservation of sentiments and emotions in translation and our assessment reveals that the lexical approach shows great inter-language agreement. However, our manual evaluation also suggests that the use of purely lexical methods is limited and further studies are necessary to pinpoint the cross-lingual differences and to develop better sentiment classifiers."
