We introduce Sentimentator; a publicly available gamified web-based annotation platform for fine-grained sentiment annotation at the sentence-level. Sentimentator is unique in that it moves beyond binary classification. We use a ten-dimensional model which allows for the annotation of 51 unique sentiments and emotions. The platform is gamified with a complex scoring system designed to reward users for high quality annotations. 
Sentimentator introduces several unique features that have previously not been available, or at best very limited, for sentiment annotation. In particular, it provides streamlined multi-dimensional annotation optimized for sentence-level annotation of movie subtitles.
Because the platform is publicly available it will benefit anyone and everyone interested in fine-grained sentiment analysis and emotion detection, as well as annotation of other datasets.
