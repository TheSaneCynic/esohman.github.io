I introduce a Sentiment and Emotion Lexicon for Finnish (SELF) and a Finnish Emotion Intensity Lexicon (FEIL). Sentiment analysis and emotion detection require annotated data regardless of the chosen approach, but most existing resources are for the English language. To overcome this, the SELF and FEIL lexicons use projected annotations from existing resources with carefully edited translations and domain adaptations. In this paper the creation process and translation issues are explained in detail to allow others to create similar lexicons for other languages. The usefulness of SELF and FEIL are demonstrated via several interdisciplinary affect-related projects. To our best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive sentiment and emotion lexicon for Finnish.
